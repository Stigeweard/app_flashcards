how a cat shows affection, the cat will clean you with its tongue or rub against you or squint its eyes
how a cat shows happiness, the pupils will get big and round and the tail will go straight up
how a cat shows fear, the cat will be frozen in place (not want to move) or it will swipe you or it will hiss or it will run away
how a cat shows contentment, the cat will be calm and relaxed sometimes giving a quick "meow" and the pupils are not dilated
